"""
This demo application provides examples of using [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/)
and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to build complex, serverless, and highly scalable
generative AI applications with prompt chaining.

The source code for these demos can be found at
[on GitHub](https://github.com/osecen/amazon-bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining).

TODO - Onder Secen: Instead of running a streamlit server on ECS for the UI, build a React based UI that can be served through a 
CloudFront distribution.
